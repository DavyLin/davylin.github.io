Apparently I'm using emacs org mode to power this
blog.Many thanks for the nice framework that save me a lot of time to
get up to speed.I probably wouldn't have decided to move my blog here in
the first place if there weren't ready-to-use solutions for lazy people
like me.

Anyway, here's the link to my old blog: http://javalinjx.iteye.com/

#+TITLE: A 6502 Home-Brew Computer

#+STARTUP: inlineimages


Thanks to a burgeoning interest in electronics, I’ve become very
interested in designing and building my own computer. I chose the 6502
out of familiarity and nostalgia. It was at the heart of my two
favorite computers, the Commodore 64 (in a slightly modified version
called the 6510) and the Apple ][. It’s a favorite of hobbyists, and
there’s a ton of software targeted to it. Plus, it’s just very easy to
design around.

* Form Factor

- Composed of two half-eurocard (80mm x 100mm) boards; one CPU and
  memory, one I/O. The design is constrained to such a small area
  because of the tool I’ve decided to use for PCB layout, CadSoft
  Eagle freeware version.
- Fully buffered bus available on each stack, for easy expansion.
- Boards are connected using standard 0.1” (2.54mm) SIP headers, à-la
  Arduino shields

* CPU

- Synertek SY6502B.
- 1MHz Crystal Oscillator (The CPU is capable of running at 3MHz, but
  I only had a 1MHz 6551 on hand).

* Memory

- 32KB NEC µPD43256AC-10L SRAM (32K x 8).
- 32KB ST 27C512 UV EPROM (64K x 8. Only the lower 16K is used), with
  a simple monitor program and 6502 Enhanced Basic.
- Simple 74HC00 or 4000 series address decoding glue logic.

* IO

- Rockwell R6522A VIA — two 8-bit parallel I/O lines.
- Rockwell R6551 ACIA — one serial I/O line, 50 to 19,200 baud.
- MAX232 RS-232 voltage converter.
- 1.8432 crystal.
